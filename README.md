# Behavioral_Cloning_Project : Predicting Steering Angles from Captured By Camera 

This project performs behavioral cloning, training an AI agent to mimic human driving behavior in a simulator. Using the vehicle's camera images collected from the human demonstration, we train a deep neural network to predict the vehicle's steering angle.  

The final trained model is tested on the same test track that was run during the human demonstration.
